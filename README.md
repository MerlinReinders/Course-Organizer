 ##Phase 4: Task 3
 Overall, I am fairly pleased with the outcome of my project. Had I had more time, I would have like to finish the 
 implementation of all the features that I initially set out to accomplish. In terms of refactoring, I am generally 
 content with the robustness of my code, however I will say that certain classes such as Title and ListTitle are 
 redundant and in a perfect world would implement a singular abstract title class or simply exist within a class 
 dedicated to titles alone. My organizer display app class could also potentially use some re-factoring. Particularly 
 the grid areas method which could similarly employ a generic grid areas class.
